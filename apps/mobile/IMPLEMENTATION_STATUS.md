## Known Issues

1. Navigation dependency issues: The project has linting errors related to @react-navigation/* dependencies. These have been temporarily fixed by creating type declarations, but proper installation of the packages is recommended.
2. Type declarations for navigation: Need to create proper type declarations for navigation parameters.
3. The analytics and monitoring services have dependencies with type errors. These should be addressed by properly installing the correct type definitions.
